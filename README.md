# android_image_script
A sweet little script that converts svgs to pngs for all densities for use with Android

## This requires you have the ImageMagick binary setup on your computer
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php
They have binaries for all major distributions

For OSX
`sudo port install ImageMagick`
is all that is required, assuming you have the pre-requiste MacPorts installation running, which can be found here:
